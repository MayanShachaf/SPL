Some of the projects from Systems programing class.
Assignment Definition:
In our studio, we offer many workout plans (options). We have talented trainers who are experts in all
of our workout options (Yoga, Pilates, CrossFit, etc.), where each exercise can be Cardio Anaerobic
or Mixed. For example, Yoga is considered an anaerobic exercise, while spinning (cycling) is a mixed
exercise.
In this assignment, we made a C++ program that
simulates a fitness studio management system. The
program open the studio, assign customers to trainers,
make a workout plan that consists of one or more workout
options, calculate the trainer's salary, and other requests as
described below.
The program get a config file as an input, including all
required information about the fitness studio opening - the
number of trainers, how many customers each trainer can
handle, and details about the studio's possible workouts.
